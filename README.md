# Internet Adoption Rates Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of global internet adoption rates. We explore the current state of internet connectivity, 
hypothesizing about whether the adoption rates are affected by GDP per capita or cost of the internet and whether adoption rates are similar across similar across regions.

## Key Findings
* Global Internet Adoption: As of 2024, the number of internet users has doubled over the past decade, reaching 4.95 billion worldwide. This growth reflects the increasing importance of digital connectivity in our lives.
* Regional Variations: The Nordics lead in internet adoption, with Norway and Denmark reporting 99% or higher internet use. Sweden and Finland closely follow, with adoption rates of 98.1% and 97.8%, respectively, at the start of 2024.
* Economic Factors: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) plays a pivotal role in internet adoption. Countries with higher GDP tend to have better infrastructure, greater investment in technology, and higher internet penetration rates. Conversely, lower GDP nations face challenges in providing widespread access.
* Cost of Internet: Affordability directly impacts adoption. High internet costs deter users, especially in low-income countries. Efforts to reduce costs and promote affordable plans can boost adoption rates.
